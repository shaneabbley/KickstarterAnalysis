# Kickstarter Outcomes Analysis
### Outline
This project utilized excel and Kickstarter data in order to determine trends in the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns. We focused our analysis on the effect of target goals and launch dates on the success of Kickstarter campaigns, then we visualized this focused data. These visualizations will help our friend Louise be better prepared when choosing a target goals and a campaign launch date for her future projects.
### Analysis
#### Methods
We added several new data columns to our original raw data. We did this by performing operations on the already existing cells. The percentage funded category shows not only whether a Kickstarter succeeded, but also by how much, and was calculated by dividing the pledged dolar amount by the target goal. The average donation is the amount backed divided by the total number of backers and allows us to see which categories/dates/goals outperformed on a per backer basis. We calculated the dates created and ended from the unix timestaps provided and the "DATE" function.
#### Challenges
Overall the methods described above were accomplished efficiently and with little error. The greatest challenge for me is formatting the graphs so they make the most sense for someone who has not been staring at the raw data, that is, designing them in a way that anybody could quickly understand the value of the data.
### Results
#### Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date
Overall the late spring and early summer months saw the greatest number of succesful Kickstarters. The month of December had significantly less successful kickstarters. Canceled and failed Kickstarters remained fairly constant all year.
#### Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns asking for over $45,000 or more in crowdfunding almost never succeeded, while Kickstarters requesting less than $5,000 had a very high success rate.
#### Limitations
It is uncertain to me whether the dollar amounts for foreign Kickstarters has been converted or not. If they have not then the analysis needs to be reevaluated. We also would benefit if we possessed data about the backers, so that we could appeal to the audience that is actually supporting campaigns.
#### Alternative Analysis
An additional pivotchart showing the total number of backers under different filters could help identify what causes the network effect for some Kickstarters. Also, a chart showing how quickly successful Kickstarters accomplished their goals could help plan time sensitive campaigns in the future.
